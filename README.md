# Marketing-Website
For website I updated some syntax in the HTML from Divs to setions, nav, aside, article etc.

I also updated the CSS and merged some classes and Ids together to clean up the code. 
Ex; I comnbined the benefits-leads, benefits brand, and benefit cost into one. 

Also the benefit-imgs was combined into one. 

The #search-engine-optimization, #online-reputation-management, #social-media-marketing was combined into one. As well as the img side.

Updated the the H1 Horiseon, deleted the span code and cleaned it up.
